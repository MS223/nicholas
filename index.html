    <p>Marines:</p>
    <p>Being a Marine is just something I've always wanted to be my whole life. Why not? if I'm eventually going to die anyways why not live my life doing something that matters. A whole bunch of people work in places like Coal Mines and they Mine in caves riski
    ng their lives for something that isn't that important to be risking your life for. I don't want to be a Marine because it looks cool I just want to be remembered and put down in History so when people see me I get respect. I want respect and for people to know that I fought for them. It's not even about fighting for my Country it's for fighting for the people and myself. This is why I want to be a Marine.</p>
